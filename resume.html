<h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Summary</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
  I've been building software professionally for over 20 years in a variety of
  languages and technologies.  For the past 7+ years my focus has been on
  Ruby/Rails and Javascript applications and it's been a blast.  I'm looking
  to continue using those tools to build software to solve real problems for real
  people.
