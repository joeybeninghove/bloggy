<h1 class="mb-4 text-4xl font-semibold">About Me</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
  I'm a <span class="font-semibold">full-stack web developer</span> living in Richmond, VA.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  I build software for the web, currently in
  <span class="font-semibold">Rails</span> and
  <span class="font-semibold">Javascript</span>, and help run a
  <a href="https://cart66.com" class="link">small software company</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="font-medium mb-2 text-2xl">A Little Work History</h3>

<ul class="mb-4">
  <li class="mb-1">I've been writing code professionally for over 20 years.</li>
  <li class="mb-1">
    I grew up in the Microsoft world, heavy into the .NET ecosystem, yes even
    that crazy ALT.NET movement.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-1">
    In 2009, my ALT.NET tendencies turned into NOT.NET, and I haven't
    looked back since.
  </li>
  <li>
    I've spent the last 10+ years mostly in Ruby and Javascript, building Rails apps from the
    ground up, mainly in the areas of functional medicine and
    <a href="https://cart66.com" class="link">ecommerce platforms</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="font-medium mb-2 text-2xl">On The Personal Side</h3>

<p class="mb-4">
  I'm blessed with a wonderful wife of 16 years (and counting!) along with 4
  children ranging from 2 to 15 years old.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  We're very thankful to have been able to homeschool all of our children
  from day one and hope to continue doing so for the next ... wait a minute
  ... we have at least another <span class="font-semibold">16 years left?!?</span>.
</p>
<p>
  As far as the non-coding things I'm in to, that would be hanging with the
  family, watching and playing baseball, farming, woodworking, speedcubing,
  disc golf and of course playing tons of board games.
