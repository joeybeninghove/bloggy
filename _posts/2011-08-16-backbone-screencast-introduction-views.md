A couple weeks ago I gave a [webinar for Develop with Passion](http://webinars.developwithpassion.com/webinars/4) on Backbone.js.  Unfortunately there was a problem with the recording, so I decided to redo what I covered in screencast form.  In this screencast I give a basic introduction on how to bootstrap a new Backbone.js application and go in-depth on how to use Backbone Views in particular.

Hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for more screencasts, including more on Backbone.js coming soon!

*Oh, and you might want to watch until the end... just sayin'*  :)
