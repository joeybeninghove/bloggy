Last week, I had a crazy notion of wanting to get a few other Ruby developers together for a completely informal late-night group chat about testing, gem dependencies and dealing with large Rails applications.  Many thanks to [Brian Hogan](http://bphogan.com), [Derick Bailey](http://derickbailey.lostechies.com) and [Mel Riffe](http://melriffe.info) for hanging with me in a Google+ Hangout last Wednesday night.  I learned a ton and it was a LOT of fun!

So, I kind of want to make this a regular thing, possibly weekly.  Using a Google+ Hangout worked out really well, but it has the disadvantage that folks with GAFYD accounts can't access Google+ (srsly, Google?!?).  Perhaps Skype would be a better, more accessible choice.  We'll figure that part out if there is enough interest.

At this point, I think the 2nd "code talk" is going to happen this Wednesday evening (hosted by [CastingCode.tv](http://castingcode.tv)), time TBA.  If this is something you'd be interested in, leave a comment below or [shoot me an email](mailto:joey@30cubits.com) and let me know and also suggest some topic ideas.  I've thought about starting to record these, so also let me know if that would be an issue for you.
