Another quick announcement about my latest Backbone.js screencast over at
[~~backbonescreencasts.com~~](#).  This time it's another one relating to Rails, [When Things Go
Wrong!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plJL_bWAMgc).  In this one I cover dealing with errors, specifically
validation errors from Rails as well as monitoring server availability and reacting to server downtime.  

## Update
Since I've retired the backbonescreencasts.com site, I've embedded the video
here for free.  :smile:
