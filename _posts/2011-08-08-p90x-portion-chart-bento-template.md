So I've been wanting a way to track my [P90X](http://www.teambeachbody.com/workout-routines/p90x-workout) nutrition program on my iPhone for a while now.  There have been a couple iPhone apps that have appeared/disappeared in the App Store due to violation with the Beach Body folks, who created the P90X program.  There have been [rumors about Beach Body themselves creating an iPhone app](http://www.teambeachbody.com/connect/message-boards/-/message_boards/search?_19_redirect=%2Fconnect%2Fmessage-boards&_19_breadcrumbsCategoryId=0&_19_searchCategoryIds=0&_19_advanced=false&_19_keywords=iphone+app&_19_categoryOnly=on&_19_searchType=0&_19_titleAndOrBody=0&_19_fromDate=&_19_toDate=08%2F08%2F2011&_19_screenName=) but no idea what's going on with that.

As much as I'd love to make an attempt at building my own iPhone app for this, I have no time for that right now and just need a simple solution to get me by.  Enter, [Bento for iPhone](http://www.filemaker.com/products/bento/iphone.html)!  My needs are very simple.  I just wanted a simple checklist of sorts that I could use to check off how many proteins, carbs, veggies, etc. that I eat in a given day.  No detail about the foods or anything, just simple tracking of how many portions from each group I've eaten.

So I created this [extremely simple Bento template](/assets/p90x-phase-1-bento-template.zip) that tracks this information for me.  Here's what it looks like.

Very simple solution to a simple need I had.  Perhaps too simple for most folks, but it's really all I need right now.  Hopefully this can help some of you guys that migh be on the P90X insane train too.  :)
