I really enjoy using and teaching others about Backbone.js.  So I decided to
[~~launch a new site~~](#) specifically for delivering 
screencasts on Backbone.js.  The first installment is now available!

## Backbone.js Quickly
Learn how to build a complete Backbone.js application from the ground up! To watch 
a preview and purchase this screencast, head on over to [~~backbonescreencasts.com~~](#).

## Update
Since I've retired the backbonescreencasts.com site, I've embedded the video
here for free.  :smile:
